# bookstore-sql-project

Welcome to my **Bookstore Database System** project!  
This project includes a fully structured **MySQL database schema**, plus an **ER Diagram** to visualize the relationships between tables.

---

## 🧱 Project Overview

This system is designed to manage a bookstore's core operations including:

- 📖 Books and Authors
- 🌍 Languages and Publishers
- 👥 Customers and Addresses
- 🛒 Orders, Shipping, and Order History

The database uses **relational modeling** with foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity.
